# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current video and audio calling system has critical issues where calls automatically end immediately after being initiated. Users are unable to establish successful voice or video connections, which severely impacts the communication functionality of the platform. This feature addresses the core calling system problems including WebRTC connection failures, socket event handling issues, and improper call state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully initiate and maintain audio calls with other users, so that I can have voice conversations without the call automatically ending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the audio call button THEN the system SHALL establish a WebRTC connection without automatically ending
2. WHEN the recipient answers the call THEN both users SHALL be able to hear each other clearly
3. WHEN either user speaks THEN the audio SHALL be transmitted in real-time with minimal latency
4. IF the call connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and retry mechanism
5. WHEN I end the call manually THEN the call SHALL terminate gracefully and clean up all resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully initiate and maintain video calls with other users, so that I can have face-to-face conversations without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the video call button THEN the system SHALL establish a WebRTC video connection without automatically ending
2. WHEN the recipient answers the call THEN both users SHALL see each other's video feeds
3. WHEN either user's camera is active THEN the video SHALL be transmitted in real-time with acceptable quality
4. WHEN I toggle video on/off during the call THEN the video stream SHALL respond immediately
5. IF the video connection degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust quality or fall back to audio-only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user receiving a call, I want to see incoming call notifications and be able to accept or reject calls, so that I have control over my communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN someone calls me THEN I SHALL receive a clear incoming call notification with caller information
2. WHEN I click accept THEN the call SHALL connect successfully within 5 seconds
3. WHEN I click reject THEN the call SHALL be declined and the caller notified
4. IF I don't respond within 30 seconds THEN the call SHALL automatically timeout and end
5. WHEN I'm already in a call THEN new incoming calls SHALL be handled appropriately (busy signal or call waiting)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user in an active call, I want reliable call controls (mute, video toggle, end call), so that I can manage my call experience effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the mute button THEN my microphone SHALL be muted/unmuted immediately
2. WHEN I click the video toggle THEN my camera SHALL turn on/off without affecting the call connection
3. WHEN I click end call THEN the call SHALL terminate immediately for both parties
4. WHEN the other user toggles their controls THEN I SHALL see the updated status in real-time
5. IF there are connection issues THEN the controls SHALL remain responsive and provide feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calling system to handle network issues gracefully, so that temporary connectivity problems don't permanently break my calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are temporary network issues THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
2. WHEN the connection is poor THEN the system SHALL display connection quality indicators
3. IF the connection cannot be restored THEN the system SHALL end the call gracefully with a clear message
4. WHEN switching between networks (WiFi to mobile) THEN the call SHALL attempt to maintain connection
5. IF WebRTC is not supported THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with browser requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for the calling system, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN call errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN WebRTC connection fails THEN the system SHALL capture and report the specific failure reason
3. WHEN socket events fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
4. IF STUN/TURN servers are unreachable THEN the system SHALL try alternative servers
5. WHEN calls fail THEN users SHALL receive helpful error messages with suggested actions
